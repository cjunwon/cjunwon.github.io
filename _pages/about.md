I am a graduate student at UC Davis pursuing an [M.S. in Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) (Data Science Track). Prior to this, I graduated from UCLA with a [B.S. in Data Theory](https://datatheory.ucla.edu/learning/), a major hosted by the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Statistics & Data Science. The Data Theory major is an interdisciplinary program that combines coursework in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain-specific applications.

As an undergraduate student, I served as the Data Editor for UCLA's student newspaper, [The Daily Bruin](https://dailybruin.com/), where I led a team of journalists in producing [data-driven stories](https://stack.dailybruin.com/). Additionally, I worked as a research intern at the [Sensing and Robotics for Infrastructure (SRI) Lab](https://sri-lab.seas.ucla.edu/) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, where I conducted research on large-scale transportation networks. I also took an academic leave to serve in the [Republic of Korea Marine Corps](https://www.rokmc.mil.kr:10005/index.do) and was discharged as a Sergeant in 2022.

Research & Projects
===

My research and project expertise span across several topics in statistics and data science. A core strength of my work is the ability to rapidly adapt to new complex datasets and deliver practical, data-driven solutions. I am particularly interested in the following areas:

- **Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling**: Spatial Statistics & Geospatial Deep Learning, Time Series Analysis, Stochastic Models, Hierarchical Modeling
- **Applications of Large Language Models & Agentic Systems**: RAG systems, Multi-agent frameworks
- **Data Privacy & Security**: Synthetic Data Generation, Differential Privacy

Some of my work can be found in [Publications](http://cjunwon.github.io/publications/) and [Projects](http://cjunwon.github.io/projects/).
