I am an incoming graduate student at UC Davis pursuing an [M.S. in Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/). Prior to this, I graduated from UCLA with a [B.S. in Data Theory](https://datatheory.ucla.edu/learning/), a major hosted by the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Statistics & Data Science.
